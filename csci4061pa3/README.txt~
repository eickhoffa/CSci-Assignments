This code was compiled and tested on KH2170-14 after completion of the program and tested on various KH2170 machines while being written.













This code is organized as follows:	Next is the traverseDirectory function that traverses the 'tree' of directories until it finds a file and then searches the file for our desired string
					Last is the main function that checks to see if there are enough/too few arguments, deletes the contents of the log.txt and out.txt files, and then calls traverseDirectory.
					

This code can be compiled by typing 'make' into the terminal and run by typing './getstring'. The './getstring' command requires two inputs, the first being an absolute path to a directory and the second being the desired string you want to find.
