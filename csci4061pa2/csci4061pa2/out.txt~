Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the
story from my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it occurred even as is here set forth.  And I would have you

 "I have no objection," Lestrade answered, seating himself. "I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of
 Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the

 American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and

o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once

in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have
so far grasped this truth that in these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say, occasionally
to embellish, you have given prominence not so much to the many causes célèbres and sensational trials in which I have figured but rather to those
incidents which may have been trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have
“And yet,” said I, smiling, “I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.”
The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my headings under this one
twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower
Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by
time—a deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them
present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
It is with a heavy heart that I take up my pen to write these the last words in which I shall ever record the singular gifts by which my friend Mr.
Sherlock Holmes was distinguished. In an incoherent and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion, I have endeavored to give some account of
complication. It was my intention to have stopped there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of

satisfied that the time has come when no good purpose is to be served by its suppression. As far as I know, there have been only three accounts in the
which I have alluded. Of these the first and second were extremely condensed, while the last is, as I shall now show, an absolute perversion of the
facts. It lies with me to tell for the first time what really took place between Professor Moriarty and Mr. Sherlock Holmes. 
I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which
