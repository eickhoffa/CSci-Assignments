This code was compiled and tested on KH2170-12 & KH4250-21 after completion of the program and tested on various KH4250 machines while being written.


This code is organized as follows:	Next is the traverseDirectory function that traverses the 'tree' of directories until it finds a file and then searches the file for our desired string
					Last is the main function that checks to see if there are enough/too few arguments and then calls traverseDirectory.
					

This code can be compiled by typing 'make' into the terminal and run by typing './getstring'. The './getstring' command requires two inputs, the first being an absolute path to a directory and the second being the desired string you want to find.
