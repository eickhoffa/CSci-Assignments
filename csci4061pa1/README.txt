This code was compiled and tested on LIND40-43 after completion of the program and tested on various KELLER4-250 machines while being written.


This code is organized as follows:	Begins with our data structure (linked list code that was given during Recitation 1)
					Next is the parse_file function which contains all of our code such as forking, waiting, executing, and checking for errors.
					Finally is the main function which contains minor code allocating space and checking to see if we have any input tags/flags
					

This code can be compiled by typing 'make' into the terminal and run by typing './custmake'. The './custmake' can also take in a flag (-n or -h) and a target (all, main, util, parseutil, fake, clean).
